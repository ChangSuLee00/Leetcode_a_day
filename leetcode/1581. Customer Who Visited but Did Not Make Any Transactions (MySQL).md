# 1581. Customer Who Visited but Did Not Make Any Transactions (MySQL)

## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/customer-who-visited-but-did-not-make-any-transactions/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

## Code

```mysql
SELECT
    v.customer_id AS customer_id, COUNT(*) AS count_no_trans
FROM
    Visits v
LEFT JOIN
    Transactions t ON t.visit_id = v.visit_id
WHERE
    t.transaction_id IS NULL
GROUP BY
    v.customer_id
```

## How to solve?

LEFT JOIN을 통해 NULL값을 가진 조인 테이블을 구해준다.

이후 GROUP BY 구문을 통해 v.customer_id 별로 COUNT()값을 묶어준다.
