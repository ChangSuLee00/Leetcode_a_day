# 1789. Primary Department for Each Employee (MySQL)

## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/primary-department-for-each-employee/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

## Approach

primary_flag가 Y인 경우는 primary department이다.

그리고 primary_flag가 N이면서 칼럼의 갯수가 1개인 경우도 primary department이다.

## Code

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR
    (
        primary_flag = 'N'
        AND
        employee_id IN (
            SELECT employee_id
            FROM Employee
            GROUP BY employee_id
            HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
        )
    )
```

## Refactoring

primary_flag = 'Y' OR 구문에서 이 뒤의 논리적 집합은 primary_flag가 N인 경우만 남는다.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, department_id
FROM Employee
WHERE primary_flag = 'Y' OR
    employee_id IN (
        SELECT employee_id
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY employee_id
        HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
    )
```
