## Source

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-salary-categories/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=top-sql-50

## Approach

Low, Average, High Salary의 COUNT를 각각 구해준 뒤 UNION ALL을 이용해서 합쳐준다.

## Code

```sql
SELECT 'Low Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income < 20000

UNION ALL

SELECT 'Average Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income >= 20000 AND income <= 50000

UNION ALL

SELECT 'High Salary' AS category,
    COUNT(*) AS accounts_count
FROM Accounts
WHERE income > 50000
```
